UNM CS 429/529 Machine Learning Project 1: Decision Trees


## Details

Details about this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/cs529-project1)


## Getting Started

**NOTE**: This repo requires [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to be installed. See the link for installation instructions.
This is installed on both `moons.cs.unm.edu` and `trucks.cs.unm.edu`. All code and scripts have been tested and will work on either of these systems.

This project uses a virtualenv for managing packages. First, you need to initialize the virtualenv:

```bash
virtualenv .venv
```

Next, activate the virtualenv in your current shell:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You can deactivate the virtualenv with the following command:

```bash
deactivate
```
